# Open-Source-Recommender
As a developer👨‍💻, I faced many problems in finding open-source projects🤷‍♂️. Don't worry! I brought you guys an application to find your open-source project by just typing in your GitHub username.✌️
The application recommends Open Source Repositories based on your interests and languages that interest you.

## Features🤖

- Retrieves repository details of a GitHub user, including project names, descriptions, programming languages, and topics.
- Searches and gathers open source projects based on user language and topic interests using the GitHub API.
- Generates recommendations by comparing user repository details with the collected open-source projects.
- Provides a web interface using Streamlit to input user information and display recommended projects with link previews.
